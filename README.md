# DataScience-Project2
Repository for the final project for Data Science class 2020

The project will focus on studying the testing practices of various countries based on their per capita GDP. To understand what is meant by good testing, it is important to read the article by Max Roser(https://twitter.com/MaxCRoser/status/1322841373251350528). The idea is that for countries that test properly, the ratio of positive cases to tests carried out is low. 

The notebook for this project can be found here(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pEZlv5zkAZzSbeTqLjtQ2L8Fv4dPfaAl).
