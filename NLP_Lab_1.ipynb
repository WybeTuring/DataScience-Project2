        "This is an attempt to write a crude sentimental analysis function. The basic idea is to have a bag of words that could likely appear in a positive review, and those that could appear in a negative review. The task is then to check for the occurence of words that are labeled as positive and those that are labeled as negative. If the positive words occur more than the negative words, we can say that the review is a positive review. If the negative words appear more than positive words, the review is negative. The situation in which the number of negative and positive words is equal means that the review is a neutral review. One way this approach could be used to provide numbered ratings (-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) will be to quantify the amounts of negative/positive words with relation to the overall number of words in the review.
